# Introduction
In this lab, our focus was on exploring the concepts of exploratory and manual functional testing within the provided ATM application. Our group shared a common understanding of testing as a method to identify and address potential issues or bugs within an application's functionalities. 

Throughout this lab, we were to focus on the ATM application that handled customer transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, account transfers, and obtaining bank statements. Our objective was to assess the functionality of the application, ensuring that each feature operated as intended or identify and log bugs that occurred.

This hands-on experience broadened our understanding of testing methodologies in terms of the difference of testings, such as exploratory and manual functional testing.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Having the opportunity to explore the application without being restricted to a predefined set of tests allowed our understanding of the application as a whole, to be fundamentally created. This approach of exploratory testing helped us become more familiar with the application's functionalities allowing our test cases to be created in such a way that encapsulated the majority of the functionalities of the application. Writing test cases was tedious but could be easily retractable as the steps to recreate the bug were noted.

Through manual functional testing, we observed that the tests during the exploratory testing phase were common as they gave us pre-defined cases that encapsulated the main functionalities of the application. Through our comparisons, we were able to gain confidence that the bugs in our exploratory phase were prominent as it was duplicated in the MFT.

Within the provided Google sheets that involved our tests, we highlighted the ones that were bugs in both the exploratory phase and MFT (for 1.0) as well as our regression testing on version 1.1. Understanding the functionalities and requirements of this application helped our exploratory phase in terms of the functionality and expected output and how to get to that point, with this we were able to figure out if the test failed or passed according to our expected output. 

Repeating the same action for the MFT, we highlighted the test cases that failed the expected output and highlighted them as bugs. We listed duplicated bugs seen on both exploratory and MFT, giving us confidence in our exploratory phase knowing we were on the right track.
